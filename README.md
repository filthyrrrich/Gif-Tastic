# Gif-Tastic

Conclusion: 

This assignment was much shorter than the previous ones(not complaining!) I was able to finish it in about 5-6hrs. It helped me better understand using APIs/AJAX. I also opted to do 12 gifs instead of 10 because it made my layout cleaner! I was going to tackle the bonus elements, but decided I should start on the next HW asap!
